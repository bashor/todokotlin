This project is a small prototype of a Kotlin multiplatform web application. 

It shares view rendering on the server and the client with 
[kotlinx.html](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.html) common code.

It includes the state of the app in the page using 
[kotlinx.serialization](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.serialization).

On the client side, it uses a basic redux implementation.
